# FAQ

## Where is my Data stored?

AsciiDraw runs - as of now - only client-side. So all your data is stored locally within your browser.
We have no access to your project or other data.

## How can I share my Project

There are multiple ways to store your project and each has their own purpose.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you share your project you are taking a snapshot of your project at that specific time.
> This means that any changes afterward are not reflected.

### Share URL

The probably simplest form is to create the share-url.
This share URL can be sent and opened by another person.

> [!WARNING]
> This URL contains your whole project and thus the URL can get very long.
> Some messengers don't support such long URL's.
> Either you won't be able to send the link or the link will be split into multiple messages.
> Both cases are unwanted, and that case it's recommended to use the [next method](#download-project) to share.

### Download Project

The second way to share your project is by downloading your project.
This file can then be sent via a messenger or mail to the other person.

### Share as Image

AsciiDraw also offers [export as image](./export/image/index.md). So you could copy the rendered image and send it via a messenger or mail to the other person.

# Export as Text

Exporting as text is the intended way.

> [!NOTE]
> As we understand that text is not always supported or can't be formatted properly by your client or application, we also support [export as image](./image/index.md)

AsciiDraw will render your project as text. You can then copy it to your clipboard and paste it into your codebase.

# Export as Text

Exporting as text is the intended way.

> [!NOTE]
> As we understand that text is not always supported or can't be formatted properly by your client or application, we also support export as [an image](./image/index.md) or [SVG](./svg/index.md).

AsciiDraw will render your project as text. You can then copy it to your clipboard and paste it into your codebase, chat or wherever you need it.

## Comment Styles

To make it compatible with your file-format you can select a comment-style.

Such as `Multiline`, `Filled Multiline`, `Quotes Multiline`, `Hashes`, `Slashes`, `Tripple-Slashes`, `Dashes`, `Apostrophies`, `Backticks`, `Four Spaces` or `Semicolons`.

> [!TIP]
> If you select `Four Spaces` you can also paste the graph in a reddit comment.

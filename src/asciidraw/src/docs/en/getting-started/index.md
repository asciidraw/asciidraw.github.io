# Getting Started

Start creating your first graphic by simply visiting our [Homepage](/) and press the Draw Something button.
Your workspace will open. A new project will be generated automatically.  

## Project

A project will include all changes you do while implementing your idea for a graphic.
We suggest creating a new project for every graphic, since you can easily switch between them.
AsciiDraw supports to have multiple projects in parallel, which means every tab could've opened a different project.

## Workspace

In the Workspace you can see and edit your graphics. You have a variety of tools in the toolkit.

Additionally, there are several alternative handle options implemented, such as right-click or keyboard shortcuts.
Find further details in the associated section of our documentation.

See: [Helpful Shortcuts](./shortcuts/index.md)

## Export

When you are happy with your graphic you can [export](./export/index.md) it. Depending on further usage you can choose pure text, image or SVG.

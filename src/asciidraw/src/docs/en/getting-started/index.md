# Getting Started

## Project

A Project is a collection of [elements](#elements) and contains all data that is required to render your graph.

AsciiDraw supports to have multiple project in parallel.

## Canvas

The Canvas renders your project for you to see and edit you graph.

See: [Helpful Shortcuts](./shortcuts/index.md)

## Elements

Elements are the different entities in your project.

e.g. [label](./elements/label/index.md) or [box](./elements/box/index.md)

## Export

When you are happy with your graph you can export it.

The first option is to [export as text](./export/text/index.md)
